# Welcome to the ISAC-SIMO project

Intelligent Supervision Assistant for Construction is [A Call for CodeÂ® with The Linux Foundation](https://www.linuxfoundation.org/projects/call-for-code/) project created by [Build Change](https://buildchange.org/) with a grant from [IBM](https://developer.ibm.com/callforcode/solutions/build-change/).

## Background

Developers from Build Change, an organization dedicated to preventing housing loss caused by disasters, placed second in the 2018 Call for Code Global Challenge with their solution PD3R (Post-Disaster Rapid Response Retrofit). Their solution provided families with the ability to immediately assess whether their home could be structurally strengthened following an earthquake.

With the support of IBM, Build Change has created a new open source artificial intelligence tool called ISAC-SIMO that extends PD3R technology to help builders, local officials, and homeowners assess the construction quality of newly built or retrofitted homes.
